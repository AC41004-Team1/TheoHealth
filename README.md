# Definition Of Done

Developed, Reviewed, Tested.

# Team Ground Rules

Meetings:
Timing:
 - Will start at 9:00 every day.
 - We will begin the bulk of the meeting at 9:05 or once everyone has joined.
 - Apologies must be provided the night prior to the meeting

Meeting etiquette:
 - Arrive punctually, we must be committed
 - Be positive and give constructive criticism to promote respect, empowerment, and courage
 - Try not to interrupt anyone - if this proves challenging we could implement a ‘hands up’ system on Teams, so whoever has their hand up can speak.
 - Stay on track - do not go into detail about very specific problems and stick to the agenda
 - If you you disagree with an idea, provide an alternative

Agile Behaviour:
 - Be positive and give constructive criticism to promote respect and courage
 - Follow our definition of done (on our meeting 1 notes)
 - Follow agile principles as much as possible - do not burnout 
 - If you need resources, motivation or a helping hand ask the SCRUM master. If its a bigger issue, come to the daily drop-in session at 1 pm or message
 - If you have questions about the work ask the PO (James S)
 - Take breaks regularly to keep productive and avoid burnout. A good time for this is at 1 pm during the drop-in session if you have no issues.
Work closely to the brief
