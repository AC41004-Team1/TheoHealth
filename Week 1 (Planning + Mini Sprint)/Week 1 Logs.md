 - Had a long discussion about the technologies we want to implement, ended up deciding on a simple HTML Front End and PHP Backend, instead of a more complicated React/JS based Front End. This was the topic of much discussion but in the end, due to the teams experience levels with various technologies we decided on PHP even if it is the older and more outdated platform.
 - Discussed 3D Model vs. 2D Model
 - Established roles within the team: Elliot/Euan as primary Front End Devs, Taha/Craig as primary Back End Devs, Jesse/Christy as primary Devs for the Visualization Feature. This was decided to maximize everyones productivity based on skills they were most proficient in.
