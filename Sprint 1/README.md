### Summary of Conversation:
Very short meeting due to a Management meeting starting at 10AM, most of the team seemed content with how we we're moving, major focus for today was discussed.

 - Emphasis on cleaning up and refining the current codebase, it had gotten out of hand with multiple people working while not maintaing an established schema for naming etc.
 - Jesse and Christy continued work on Visualization
 - Griffin, Craig & Euan focussed on cleaning up and refactoring the code, as well as handling the resulting merge conflicts and cleaning up the Git
 - Elliot continued work on the dashboard. However, to maintain uniformity it was committed to the Repo and then worked on together with Euan & Craig, as plans for the Dashboard had expanded.
 - Decided on meeting on Thursday Morning at 11AM @The Tinsmith to go over the Marking Scheme together.
 - Decided on a few short questions for Griffin to ask during the management meeting.
